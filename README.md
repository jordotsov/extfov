make your scripts FOV streamable in a few minutes with this, you can convert this into an exe for easy access for anybody. this uses writefile to communicate via roblox script to python, probally not the best method but it works suprisngly well.

to use just drag Iniuria.exe to your workspace folder, or the same if your using the .py.
